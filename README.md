# Fake News Detection using Soft Computing

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to detect fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The system analyzes textual patterns to classify news as real or fake.

## 🎯 Objective
To build an automated fake news detection system that improves accuracy and reduces misinformation spread.

## 🧠 Methodology
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Classification using Machine Learning models
- Web-based interface for live demonstration

## 📊 Results
The proposed model achieves higher accuracy compared to traditional approaches.

## 💻 Live Demo
Open `demo.html` to test the fake news detection interface.
